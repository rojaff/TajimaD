Calculate a genome-wide estimate of Tajima's D, and optionally use simulation from the neutral model to correct for bias due to a minor-allele-frequency filter and perform a significance test.

The TajimaD function is part of the r2vcftools package, developed by Nathaniel S. Pope, and can be found here: https://github.com/nspope/r2vcftools
